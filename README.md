 # Sprint_Race_Car_Chassis_Analysis
 A parametric model of the sprint race car's chassis constructed in SOLIDWORKS. 
 The model is defined with a total of 20 design parameters and static torsional analysis are performed. See the figures provided. 
 ## Perform the following steps for torsional analysis: 
 1. Open SLDPRT file and select any design from the Design Tree
 2. Go to Simulation -> Study Advisor and create New Study
 3. Select Static Type Analysis
 4. To define boundary conditions; right click on Fixtures and select Fixed Geometry
 5. Select endpoints of the chassis and fix them in all directions (see figures)
 6. To apply forces; right click on External Loads and select Force
 7. Define forces of same magnitude and opposite direction (see figures)
 8. Finally, create the mesh and run the analysis
